                                        <p>NDRF has been sanctioned a NP-MICAV Project to study Effect of Morphing Wing
                                            on Micro Air Vehicles MICAVs). Morphing the wings as in natural filers has
                                            several advantages. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the cost and
                                            benefits of the three different designs-elbow joint on wing rotation, for
                                            enhanced lift. The main aim of the project is to develop a 300 mm Flapper
                                            Wing MAV with elbow joints based using a small spring. The elbow is allowed
                                            to bend during upstroke and straightness during down/power stroke. A
                                            flapping wing MICAV with elbow joints “frozen” was used. A pin was inserted
                                            through the elbow joint to prevent bending at the joint. This MAV has an
                                            all-up weight of 17.5 gms, endurance of 14.2 minutes and runs on a 130mAHr
                                            3.7 V LiPo battery. Flight tests have proved that the lateral stability
                                            gets affected with the elbow joint. Springs of different stiffness were
                                            tried out to confirm stability issues different CG locations were tested
                                            with no change in the stability issue. However, although straight line
                                            flight is relatively stable, but even the slightest change in heading would
                                            lead to a compromise in stability. This particular design needs further
                                            studies to understand the cause of instability to enable us to take
                                            advantage of the benefits of low velocity lift offered by these
                                            arrangements in the absence of any literature on this subject. </p><br>

                                            NDRF is developing a Transitioning VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing)
                                            under a NP-MICAV project. VTOL platforms have several advantages, the most
                                            important being their ability to take off and land from confined spaces and
                                            the ability to hover and stay stationary at any position. VTOL platforms in
                                            hover are very stable platforms for various sensors, including imaging and
                                            chemical detection.

                                            This 300mm micro transitioning vehicle is a flying wing planform and
                                            utilizes a bi-rotor configuration in hover mode. Either elevons, or
                                            independent motor tilt will be utilized for control during hover. In hover
                                            mode, the bi-rotors will utilize contra rotating propellers and have
                                            independent speed controls using high update rate controllers.

                                        <p>
                                            To enter the fixed wing mode, the motors will tilt forward until the MICAV
                                            transitions completely. Control during high alpha, for fast hover, will
                                            also be possible.

                                            Flapping wing MICAV or Ornithopter attempt to imitate wing kinematics and
                                            utilize the flapping wings for lift and thrust. Because of their near

                                            it) they will have the ability to get close to the object of interest
                                            un-noticed. Their physical appearance also aids in stealth operation

                                            Flappers are much more power efficient than rotary wings. Flappers also
                                            have the ability to hover, and sometimes even fly backwards making them
                                            very maneuverable platforms. Flappers can also fly past windows, doors and
                                            through corridors to help collect more data from the area of interest.

                                            disaster management. The Project was reviewed in January 2015 by the Review

                                        <p>NDRF was sanctioned to build a simulation model of nitric oxide biosensor,
                                            using enzyme kinetics. The model is a cumulation of enzyme kinetic
                                            behaviour of the each enzyme in the biosensor. It was concluded that
                                            experimental variation exists within a system that needs to be taken into
                                            consideration which makes it unsuitable for integration into the sensor.

                                        <p>NDRF has taken up a project jointly with Indian Council of Medical Research
                                            (ICMR) to develop a Glucometer for Non-Invasive Measurement of Blood
                                            Glucose in Diabetic Patients by using (Near Infra-Red-NIR) NIR- emitter and
                                            silicon photo detector with wave length of 100 to 1100nm. The instrument
                                            measures the absorbance of NIR in the blood and displays the readings on
                                            the display as ADC (analogue to digital values) which is computed to the
                                            blood glucose levels in Mg/dl. and displayed on the instrument or computer
                                            screen using proprietary software application. The advantages of using this
                                            glucometer are that, it needs no piercing of the Skin, no blood samples are
                                            taken and hence doesn’t cause any pain to patients. As it does away with
                                            needles or chemical strips there is no cost involved to buy them. Once the
                                            Meter is purchased, the only cost that is involved is in purchasing the
                                            battery, which is a consumable. One diabetic patients who have to undergo
                                            repeated tests of their blood glucose level will certainly find cost
                                            reduction in their expenses, using this unit. <br>

                                            with Indus Biomedical Devices has been progressed well. The first Prototype
                                            was successfully validated and clinical trials conducted at Jnana
                                            Sanjeevini Medical Centre & Diabetes Hospital Bangalore. It is expected
                                            that the final Non Invasive Glucometer can be delivered with the
